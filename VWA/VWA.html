  <h3>Journal</h3>

 <p> <h4>Thursday, 15th of December 2022:</h4> <br>
Today I tried searching for topics and the corresponding research questions. I asked around on my Discord (see discord.com) server which is a radio astronomy and general space-related science server. Some members there are professional physicists or studying something related, so I figured it would be a good idea to ask them. I already had ideas in my mind, it should be something either Astro and/or Quantum physics related, preferably close related to radio astronomy. I also used Large Language Model ChatGPT (see openai.com and chat.openai.com/chat) to help me and it actually gave me good ideas. In the following are the topics and research questions I (and the people from the Discord server and ChatGPT) came up with:
<br><br>
1. "The history of radio astronomy."
This could involve researching the early pioneers of the field, such as Karl Jansky and Grote Reber, and exploring the key breakthroughs and milestones that have contributed to our understanding of the universe.
<br>-Research question: "How has the field of radio astronomy evolved over time, and what have been the most significant contributions to our understanding of the universe?"
<br><br>
2. "The role of radio astronomy in the search for extraterrestrial life."
This could involve researching the various methods that astronomers use to search for signals from other civilizations, as well as the challenges and limitations of this type of research.
<br>-Research question: "What are the current state-of-the-art techniques used in the search for extraterrestrial life, and what are the limitations and challenges of this research?"
<br><br>
3. "The mathematical foundations of radio astronomy."
This could involve researching the various mathematical principles and techniques that are used in the field, such as signal processing and data analysis.
<br>-Research question: "What are the key mathematical concepts and techniques that are used in radio astronomy, and how do they enable us to study the universe?"
<br><br>
4. "The role of radio astronomy in testing fundamental theories of physics (such as general relativity and quantum mechanics.)"
This could involve researching how radio astronomy observations can be used to test these theories, as well as the challenges and limitations of this type of research.
<br>-Research question: "How do radio astronomy observations help us to test fundamental theories of physics, and what are the challenges and limitations of this approach?"
<br><br>
5. "The role of radio astronomy in studying the early universe."
<br>-Research question: "What can radio telescopes tell us about the early stages of the universe, and how do these observations help us to better understand the origins of the universe?"
<br><br>
6. "The search for gravitational waves using radio astronomy."
-Research question: "How do gravitational waves affect radio waves, and how do astronomers use this effect to detect and study gravitational waves?"
<br><br>
7. "The role of radio astronomy in mapping the structure of the universe."
<br>-Research question: "How do radio telescopes help us to understand the distribution of matter in the universe, and what have we learned about the large-scale structure of the universe from this research?"
<br><br>
8. "The use of radio astronomy to study black holes."
<br>-Research Question: "How do astronomers use radio waves to study black holes, and what have we learned about these mysterious objects from this research?"
<br><br>
9. "The role of radio telescopes in studying the universe."
<br>-Research question: "How do radio telescopes work, and what types of objects and phenomena can they be used to study?"
<br><br>
I will ask my preferred supervisor/teacher what they thinks of these when I see them next and then continue doing my research on the topic and come up with further ideas and make a plan on what to do.
