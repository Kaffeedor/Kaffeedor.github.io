    <h3>"Stats" and General stuff</h3>
    <p>Haii there, so, uh, I'm Murphy. I got that name because 1. It is a cool name to be honest and 2. My "real"-/"dead"-name doesn't work with other pronouns really. About that, it is fine to call me like that (for now, 15.10.22). I mean it is a good name. Fedor.
    My Aliases/Gamertags are the following few names for the most stuff: cato, kaffeedor and fedornaut. I was born in 2004, so I'm 18 while making this. I was born and live and study here in Innsbruck, which is in Austria.
    So for my physique, I'm pretty skinny and somewhat tall I guess? 183-ish centimeters, I don't know. I got blue eyes and my hair are naturally blonde.
    Anyways now, uh gender, what the fuck. So, I am not aware of what the fuck is happening- no but fr idk what my gender is, socially I am male (in public-/family-ish) but I don't know I am slowly leaning towards Female.
    Thats why I currently use any/all pronouns pretty much and I would appreciate if <i>you</i> wouldn't just use one pair of pronouns but sometimes that one sometimes that (So like she/her, it/its, they/them, he/him, ..., this is also in order from what I like the most altough the middle two are kinda on the same level.
    Sexuality-wise I can "read" myself better I think, I'm somewhere on the Bi-Spectrum (Bi-, Pan-, Omnisexual, not Polysexual tho -ish).
    I think? Romantic-Wise it is the same? I do not really know but I think it is the same (Bi-, Pan-, Omniromantic). Relationship-wise I am okay with an open relationship, I am not really Poly, like my partner could like have something with anyone (with talking/saying it tho!) but like not too much emotional connection there.
    I want love rreeeeee. Also, I am pretty kinky I guess. Anyways <a href="https://spectrum.avris.it/rW0M">here</a> is something where you can see what I just wrote in not-text form.</p>
    
    <h3>Interests and Hobbys</h3>
    <p>I am pretty unmotivated and lazy often so that I am building this website is pretty nice/sepcial actually lmao.
    My main interestes are in Physics and Computer Science. With Physics especially Astrophysics, Particlephysics and Quantumphysics. With Computer Science it is coding/programming and I am fan of open-source but also, overarching with Physics, Quantumcomputing but also AI.
    I am also a phone nerd, I am trying to know what every phone is only by looking at the camera yk?! Mostly it is easy because so many people have iPhones lol, but I am more looking at recognizing other phones than iPhone.
    Altough I hate Apple, I kinda love iOS because it is SO smooth and also iPhone cameras are top. Would never have an iPhone tho as I would miss too much. Currently I got a OnePlus Nord (12GB/256GB), it is a good phone, generally OnePlus was pretty cool.
    I do not really know what phone I would get next if this one broke..
    Anyways that was enough about Phones for now, more on that on some Blog-post sometime in the future probably.
    I also like to play some video games, I am playing Squad and Overwatch 2 currently, I would be down for some Minecraft if anyone plays again.
    Space stuff is also pretty cool (rockets, solar missions, telescopes, galaxies,...), thats physics tho mostly.
    I am also interestied in computers in general but I don't look at the market currently really so I got no clue what is going on right now.
    I am also kinda into Art but I am not really looking at other artworks too much as I don't wanna be influenced too much. What I really wanna do right now is get some blood of myself with a syringe and then draw something with that.
    I will probably draw some more and upload it around here somewhere someday.
    Okay music, I like music, I can not pinpoint a genre tho which I like especially, I just listen to everything and like everything that my ears like, I sadly often like songs that I do not absolutly love but think I <i>kinda</i> like them, which results in 1000s of songs in my Spotify Liked and playlists.
    I also make music sometimes, mostly troll music with a friend of me but I wanna make a bit more serious music and got one song already which I am not completly satisfied yet but I like the direction.
    Generally I love science and am interested in many topics there to be honest. </p>
      
    <h3>Some more shit</h3>
    <p>So if you asking WHY I got this website, I do not fucking know, I got motivated for some reason (now, thinking about it, I may know one more reason), also I had an old website but it was much simpler and worse.
    Mentally if I am okay? I do not know, probably. I do not go to therapy or anything so yeah I'm probably okay and also no one could diagnose me with anything so yeah lol.
    I am pretty shy (sober, but even drunk there is some stuff I just can't).
    If I am hot? Yes! (Well yes but idk, something is bothering me about my body still often, especially hair and face, if I got no make-up even more, not all the time tho).
    I am leftist, do not have a specific ideology currently tho, I do not think people discrimnating people should have any right for freedom of speech, nor anti-science people. Yeah, that is about it.
    Oh, and I am single lol (DM me and we get to know each other, ask me for a date, or some shit idk, I am currently down bad fuck you).  
    </p>
